\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\subsection*{Preamble} \label{sec:preamble}

The future of Production Industry lies with smarter systems.  With
current developments pursuing the goal of more aware, more
decentralized behaviors in factories, a scientific platform for
applied research was required.  The RoboCup Logistics League sponsored
by Festo is determined to develop into a state-of-the-art
platform for mobile robotics education. This industrial motivated
league keeps the focus on challenges promoting precise actions,
further encouraging external data supported autonomy.

This year's competition environment is laid out in the pages to come.
It ensures the same and fair circumstances for all participants, it
however is neither meant to dictate nor suggest the way how to fulfill
the task, but is meant to develop the Logistics League further towards deploying
Automated Guided Vehicles in industrial applications. This includes current
challenges of developing industry-wide standards for Cyber Physical Production
Systems like designing plug-and-produce capable systems.

After an exciting RoboCup in Mexico, we look forward to a new scale of
competition that will emerge from initiatives around the globe. In
2012 we had our first Logistics League World Champion.  In 2013 we
introduce the Referee Box changing the competition at its core by
introducing a flow of information.  This allows for more dynamic games
and the automatic tracking of scores, and to relax the hitherto
existing regulations regarding additional computing power.

Finally, no rulebook is perfect. Feel obliged to inform us about
issues you like to discuss or gaps that might have an impact on the
competition, so we can keep the necessity for rule discussions at the
RoboCup event to a minimum. We are open for all kinds of suggestions;
the set of rules will be fixed at 01/01/2013 and revised in April 2013
after the German Open 2013 competition.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Task}
\label{sec:task}

Our aim is to simulate autonomous guided vehicles in industrial
applications. In opposition to regular automatic guided vehicles teams
shall complete the following task without human interference as
successful as possible, competing with a second team against the clock.

The Logistics League's main challenge is a multistaged production cycle
of different product variants with self-crafted intermediate products
and delivery of the final product. This genuine goal will be
rewarded considerably higher than partial fulfillment of the task.
Autonomous robots transport hockey pucks which act as a placeholder for
(intermediate) products between the processing machines. A machine can
basically be understood as a signal light with an attached RFID reader
as described in Appendix \ref{apx:sec:engref}. Each puck carries an ID
tag which will be read and processed according to the related machine's
specification. If procurable this will lead to a new puck state: a new
sub-assembly is produced or prepared. Complete workorders require all
related sub-assemblies of dynamic product variants (cf.
\refsec{sec:prodportfolio} for details). Transformations can rely on
more than one puck as input to be triggered.

This work flow is controlled by a referee box broadcasting information
via wifi (see \refsec{sec:referee box}). The work flow itself is
divided into two different phases: in an exploration phase (see
\refsec{sec:expphase}) robots receive scores for correctly discovering
and publishing the yet unknown types of the different machines on the
field. After expiration of this phase the referee box will announce all
machine types and designations. Succeeding into the second game phase
the actual production tasks as described in detail in
\refsec{sec:production-phase} is disclosed to the teams and their
robots.

The whole factory area can be used as an intermediate storage. Finally
successfully assembled products are to be delivered to the correct
delivery gate and get unloaded into its delivery slot. The factory area
has to be treated in the best possible way. Any possible damage to the
field or the machines will be penalized by the referee.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Agreements \& Regulations} \label{sec:agreements}

The Logistics League follows a certain design philosophy. All teams are
obliged to use the Robotino robotic system from Festo Didactic GmbH \&
Co. KG with certain freedoms and limitations. The usage of all
currently publicly available revisions is in order see
\refsec{sec:robotino} and Appendix~\ref{apx:sec:engref} for further
details. All available sensor equipment that does neither exceed
Robotino's diameter~\ref{apx:sec:robot}  nor require external
assistance (like Indoor GPS) is permitted.

\section{Competition Area} \label{sec:area}


\subsection{Field dimensions} \label{sec:competition-area} The point
of origin for each statement within this rulebook that uses relative
coordinates is the bottom left corner of the competition area namely
the corner near robot insertion area below the blue input storage
area. All indicated sizes of mark-ups are to be considered outside
dimensions.

The competition area is a \SI{5.625 x 5.625}{\metre} large arena with
several RFID-mounted machines, mark-ups, a stock of raw-material and a
delivery zone. It is surrounded by boards, \SI{0.5}{\metre} of height
to reduce object interference from outside the area. The default width
for mark-ups is \SI{19}{\milli\metre}, the default color is black.

The factory area spans across \SI{4.8 x 5.625}{\metre}. There are two
boundaries, set by two mark-ups, \SI{0.4}{\metre} from the left and
right borders of the competition area. The factory area is joined by
two opposing \SI{0.4 x 1.0}{\metre} zones at the left and right
middle. The left zone is painted blue marking the \textit{input
  storage area} with the \textit{late order insertion point} to the
top. The insertion area is \SI{0.6}{\metre} of depth with the
insertion slot in its middle. This spot is a \SI{0.1 x 0.1}{\metre}
empty square that will be equipped with a pallet carrier to start the
late order challenge. The space between the recycling unit and the
late order insertion point, as well as the space to the left of the
input storage area is called \textit{robot insertion area}.

The right zone is marked green and houses the three \textit{delivery
  gates}.  Each gate is of \SI{0.3}{\metre} height with
\SI{0.1}{\metre} space to the next delivery gate separated by black
mark-ups.

The delivery gates feature one signal per gate placed in middle of
each gate zone. The delivery slot resides besides a unit that is
identical in construction to a production machine. Each of the three RFID
devices within these gates feature a black centered square of \SI{0.1
  x 0.1}{\metre} called delivery slot, which resides exactly below the
RFID device. Only a pallet carrier that is delivered into the slot
completely will be considered for scoring, i.e. no part of the pallet
carrier may be outside the slot boundary.

A total of 13 machines are placed within the competition area: 10
machines representing the multistaged production process, two machines to
recycle consumed pallet carrier and one test station. The machines of
the production process are placed within the factory area as stated in
the table below. They are aligned in a \ang{90} angle (the facing direction may change during the tournament). Each production machine resides in the
centre of a squared machine space spanned by standard mark-ups with
\SI{0.6}{\metre} each side.

The 3 additional machines are arranged in the corners of the
competition area, and aligned at \ang{45}, facing the center of the
factory area. The lower left corner will remain empty. The competition
area is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:competition-area}.

They share the same design and the same RFID device, with the overall
size of (height $\times$ width $\times$ depth) \SI{280 x 160 x
100}{\milli\metre}. Confer also Appendix~\ref{apx:sec:engref} for further
details. Machines can be in different states which are communicated by their
signal lights. If a (intermediate) product is fed into a machine, the machine
reads the RFID tag and checks whether or not the product can be processed and
induces the result by its signal light. The reading and writing process is a
delicate process. To avoid corruption of the data carrier, it should not leave
the working range of the RFID device once the processing or consuming is started. To enable the production process it is necessary to transport the
pallet carrier accurately to the RFID device. A consumed pallet carrier has to
stay within the machine space borders (no part of the puck being outside the
mark-up) until the production cycle of that very machine has been completed.
Products resulting from violating this requirement are considered junk and will
not be rewarded. The machine always processes the required pallet carrier
delivered last, all prior components will be consumed. All machines will start
processing the data carrier as soon as it enters the machine zone as stated in
section~\ref{sec:competition-area}. They will change their operating mode
according to Tables~\ref{tab:production-machines}--\ref{tab:test-machine}.

\subsubsection{Production Machines - during exploration phase}
\label{sec:production-machines-exp}
During the exploration phase the robots have to explore the unknown factory
environment and identify the positions of different machine types on the
competition area. The frequency of machine types is defined in
Table~\ref{tab:production-machines}. The machines will indicate their different
types by individual light signals. In total there are seven light signals
possible with at least one led switched on. The light signals and the
corresponding machine types are initially unknown. The Referee Box will assign
every machine type to a light signal and publish it to the robots. The
exploration phase starts with the \emph{exploration phase start-up message}
published by the Referee Box which defines the light signals of the machine types, e.g.,
red and green LED switched on indicate machine type \T1. If a robot perceives
the red and green LED light switched on at machine \m1, the robot has to
announce that machine \m1 is of type \T1 to the Referee Box. Therefore, the
robot has to send a \emph{machine identified message} to the Referee Box. Please
consult the RoboCup Logistics League Referee Box Specification for a detailed
definition of the message types.


\subsubsection{Production Machines - during production phase}
The default operating mode of all machines implies that only the green LED is
turned on. This signals that the machine is ready for input. If an appropriate
product is fed to the machine, the yellow LED turnes on indicating that the
machine is processing the product (green and yellow LED on). If the machine needs another
sub-assembly to generate an output, the green LED turns off and the yellow light
indicates that the machine is waiting for the next subassembly. If the yellow
LED is turned off after further input materials are fed to the machine, the
green LED indicates that the machine has finished the work order and the last
carrier is transformed to its corresponding output. If a product is fed to a
machine which is not appropriate, the machine reacts with a yellow light
flashing at 2 Hz. A red light indicates that the machine is in an error state.
In this case no products can be processed on the machine.
Table~\ref{tab:production-machines} summarizes the operating modes of the
production machines and the corresponding signal lights.

In order to complete the machines' work order the input materials have to be
delivered one-by-one into the RFID device's action range. Multiple data
carriers in range of the device will result in erroneous behavior of the
device. Consumption of materials, such as \s0 used in the production of \s2,
will take 2 seconds. Unloading the machine can be done immediately after the
operating mode changes away from  processing. As long as the machines are used
properly, they will not produce any junk. The distribution describes how many
machines of the respective types will be randomly placed resulting in a total of
10 court machines.

\subsubsection{Recycling Unit (former market place)}
During the staged production process raw-material is transformed or consumed by
the machines. To refeed consumed raw-materials, the robots can use one of the
two recycling units placed in the corners of the competition area. The recycling unit processes all supplied loading carriers
back to raw-material (\s0) within 2 seconds. The optical feedback provided by
the recycling unit differs from an ordinary production machines and is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:recycling-unit}.

\subsubsection{Delivery Gates} 

If a variant of a final product is finished, it has to be delivered to the
customer through one of the three delivery gates. As soon as a pallet carrier is
successfully delivered to the active gate, it will show the state of the data
carrier as described in Table~\ref{tab:delivery-gates}. This state will only last for
some seconds for indicating the score to the referee. There will be
only one active gate at a time.

\subsubsection{Test Station}

Whether or not a sub-assembly is corrupted can be ensured by checking the test
station in the corresponding corner of the competition area. The test station reads
the RFID of the pallet carrier and visualizes the product type with the light signal as shown in Table~\ref{tab:test-station}.

\section{The Robotino System} \label{sec:robotino}

All participants have to design their competition Robotinos within
the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item Any kind of sensors can be changed or added to the Robotino
  platform.  However, it is not possible to implement sensors that
  require modifications outside the Robotino area (e.g. Northstar,
  indoor GPS).  It is furthermore strictly forbidden to implement any
  kind of RFID device into the Robotino. There must be no changes to
  the controller or mechanical system. The pushing device is defined
  as a passive, non-mechanical load handling attachment. The robots
  peripherals must neither exceed the maximum total height of
  \SI{0.7}{\metre} nor the \SI{0.4}{\metre} diameter of the body
  cylinder. The only exception to this is the one default mounted
  pushing device per robot. The pushing device can be modified; it
  however must not exceed the following outside dimensions: \SI{0.25 x
    0.15 x 0.05}{\metre}.
\item It is allowed to install additional computing power on the
  \Robotino. This may either be in form of a notebook/laptop device or
  any other computing device that suits the size requirement of the
  \Robotino{} competition system. Furthermore, it is allowed to
  communicate with an additional computing device off-field. This
  device may be used for team coordination and/or other
  purposes. However, communication among the robots and the off-field
  device is not granted during the competition.
\end{itemize}

For a detailed technical description, refer to the
Appendix~\ref{apx:sec:engref}.

\section{Communication}
Robots have to operate autonomously, that is, without any human
interference during the game. Communication among robots and to
off-board computing units is allowed only using wifi
(cf.~\refsec{sec:wifi-regulations}). Communication is not guaranteed
and may be unavailable during parts of the game. Interruptions must be
expected and are no reason to pause or abort a game, even if they
endure for long periods of the game.

\subsection{Bandwidth Allocation}
\label{sec:bandwidth}
No minimum bandwidth is guaranteed. The amount of communicated data
over the wifi connection shall not exceed
\SI{2}{\mega\bit\per\second}. Even though the lower layers could
provide for more bandwidth, the overall available frequency spectrum
and wifi channels have to be shared, not only within our own
league. Generally, a conservative use of bandwidth resources is
advised. Should a frequently or endured exceedance of the bandwidth
limit become known, or if the overall bandwidth limit must be reduced
due to outer circumstances, the TC can monitor the network traffic and
demand reduction in communicated data as necessary.

\subsection{Referee Box}
\label{sec:referee box}
The referee box (referee box) is a software system that runs on a system
provided by the Organization Committee. It controls the overall game,
monitors feedback from team robot, and awards points. It is instructed
by an assisting human referee and keeps a log of all relevant game
events. The final game report will be produced by the referee box. While we
strive for a maximum of automation of this control task, we rely on
the human referee for final judgment, in particular for border or
under-specified cases, and will provide the largest set of override
abilities feasible.

The referee box is the single point of instruction for robots during the
game. After game setup has finished, game state information and orders
are announced by the referee box. Commands must be acknowledged. In certain
situations (for example during the exploration phase) for successful
and true communication with the referee box points are awarded. The aim is
to reduce human interference year by year to a minimum as to exhibit
the widest autonomy during the game possible. Ultimately, the referee box
should be able to fully control the game by itself, transforming all
participants, team members, and visitors alike into pure spectators of
the game, sometimes providing maintenance and crisis intervention when
necessary.

The communication from the referee box to the robot is a datagram-oriented
broadcast protocol based on Google protocol buffers\footnote{Available
  at \url{https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/}} (protobuf). The
protocol definition and technical parameters are described in detail
in the RoboCup Logistics League Referee Box Specification.

\subsection{Remote Control}
\label{sec:remote-control}
Remote operation or instruction of any kind of the robots is forbidden
at all times during a game. The only allowed interaction is for the
single button click start-up (cf.~\refsec{sec:game-start}). Any
failure to comply with this rule will lead to immediate
disqualification of the infringing team.

\subsection{Monitoring}
\label{sec:monitoring}
\emph{Passive} monitoring, i.e. receive-only communication from a base
station of the robots' performance is allowed. However, the overall
bandwidth limit may not be exceeded.
%, this includes in particular, but
%is not limited to, images and other raw data.
If the referee has any reason to belief that a monitoring application
might be used for instruction, he can demand the shutdown of the
monitoring software (also refer to previous section on Remote
Control).

\subsection{Inter-Robot Communication}
\label{sec:inter-robot-comm}
Robots currently active on the field can freely exchange any
information that supports a coordinated team play. Robots not actively
participating in the game, for example because they have been
irrevocably removed from the current game, may not communicate with
the other robots. It is forbidden to communicate with any sensors that
are not physically attached to the robot, including, for example, but
not limited to a camera aside the field. Likewise any off-robot
actuator is forbidden.

\subsection{Communication Eavesdropping and Interference}
\label{sec:comm-tampering}
% This might sound harsh, but it's based on lessons learned in
% numerous years of RoboCup, you wouldn't believe what some teams will
% do... :-/
Communication of another team may neither be eavesdropped on nor be
interfered with. Teams not currently active shall disconnect from the
field access points.

Monitoring of bandwidth used or of possible misbehavior may only be
performed by members of the TC.
% can add this, need to be clear that this must be done using a team
% leader majority vote and not just any team leader
% or by a person appointed by the team leaders.
Any indication of misbehavior will be discussed by the team leader
convention and may result in penalties or disqualification from the
tournament.


%Each robot has to operate autonomously. The communication between the
%robot and the device responsible for the Start/Stop command, as well
%as all communication amongst the robots has to be realized using the
%Wi-Fi connection. The program controlling the robot has to be executed
%locally by the robot itself. % It is strictly forbidden to use any kind
%% of external server acting as command point.
%\begin{rulechange}
%  The robots will receive their commands from the Referee-Box as
%  specified in the referee box protocol. Further, communication to one
%  dedicated off-board computing device is allowed. However, wifi
%  communication should not taken for granted during competition by the
%  participating teams. 
%\end{rulechange}
%The robots are allowed to share information with other devices, but
%must receive nothing else but the start, pause and stop command
%from units other than the 2 fellow robots. This specifically excludes:
%Usage of processed image data created outside of the robots A central
%communication that requires a device other than the three Robotinos A
%permanently established connection between the command device and the
%Robotinos.

\subsection{Wifi regulations}
\label{sec:wifi-regulations}
In order to provide the optimal possible solution for wireless
communication during the event, all teams are required to use the
\SI{5}{\giga\hertz} wifi equipment. They are furthermore required to
connect their Robotinos wifi unit to the access point provided. All
teams can also relay on wifi clients supplied by Festo but are not
required to. A detailed description concerning the infrastructure can
be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:wifi-equipment}.

% Please refer to Sect.~\ref{sec:radio-interference} for further details.

\section{Gameplay}
A match is defined by two contesting teams competing at two separated
identical competition areas. Each team consists of a maximum of 3
robots. Each match consists of 5 minutes of setup time,
a 3 minute exploration phase, and a 15 minute production phase. All
settings, including the late order challenge and other random events,
will be the exact same for both parties of a match. The three phases
of the game are detailed below.

\subsection{Environment Setup}
\label{sec:}

The physical distribution of the production machines is fixed. Their
alignment will be randomized during the tournament setup. The machine type of each production
machine will be randomized prior to each match. The processing time of
each machine type will be determined in the same way, so the waiting
time during a match will be static for each machine of all machine types
(e.g. all T1 could have 7 seconds processing time). The
active delivery gate will also be randomized prior to each match but
during a match the active gate can switch.

\subsection{Game Phases}
\label{sec:game-phases}

\subsubsection{Team Setup}
\label{sec:team-setup}
No team member is allowed to enter the competition area prior to or
during a match. The robots can be set up within the robot insertion
area as long as they are outside the factory area and have not been
elevated into their autonomous state. During a match the manipulation
is limited to adjustments on sensors, checking cable connections and
the boot or shut down procedure. A team can ask the referee to shut
down the robot. If this motion has been forwarded within the first 15
seconds of the very robot's movement and without this robot scoring
points, the referee will move it to a point of insertion of the team's
choice, once. Otherwise or on second occasion the robot will be
removed from the competition area. A shut down may take a maximum of 60 seconds.
Otherwise the robot will be removed. Resetting or removing a robot will not
cause an interruption of the game. The referee will only interrupt the game if
there is no other way to reset the robot without interfering with the other
ongoing processes. Once removed from the competition area the robot cannot be
reinserted during the same match.
%A team can also decide to remove their robot from the competition area
%at any time of the match.

\subsubsection{Game start} \label{sec:game-start}
All matches will start at the exact time scheduled by the organization
team. From this point on, the teams involved are allowed to start their
robots to work autonomously within one minute. This can be done by
issueing one single distinct command via any kind of interface or pressing a
button on the robot. Robots which remain inactive after this minute will be
extracted from the field.

\subsubsection{Exploration Phase} \label{sec:expphase} 
With the start of the game, the exploration phase begins. For three
minutes all machines indicate their type using the signal lights. The
signal light encoding of machine types will be published by the referee box
as described in \refsec{sec:production-machines-exp} and in detail in
the RoboCup Logistics League Referee Box Specification. The robots are
to roam the environment and announce the detected types to the referee box.
Each properly reported signal scores two points, each signal reported
wrongly will give \num{-1} points penalty. A minimum of zero points
will be accounted for this exploration phase. Production or moving
pucks is not allowed during the exploration phase.


\subsubsection{Production Phase}
\label{sec:production-phase}

With the end of the exploration phase, the actual production begins,
which lasts \num{15} minutes. The referee box publishes all information
regarding products and machines. This includes position, orientation,
and type of each machine, as well as the different product variants
that can be produced and the time windows for production of each
variant. 


\subsection{Production portfolio}
\label{sec:prodportfolio}

The production portfolio is presented in
Table~\ref{tab:production-table} and in
Fig.~\ref{fig:production-diagram}, which presents the same information
as a production graph.

\subsubsection{The production table}

Table~\ref{tab:production-table} shows the production table for the
main challenge; the multistaged production processes as well as the
Late Order Challenge. The main challenge can be repeated as long as
enough pallet carriers can be provided to complete the cycle. The
different machine types are specified in Sect.~\ref{sec:machines}.



\subsubsection{Late order}

The late order challenge is derived from the former express good
rule. It will be announced at a random time by the referee box in form of a
request for a specified product to be delivered within a specified time
window. The challenge requires a fast paced processing and delivery of
the requested product in time. The challenge also requires prior
knowledge concerning the machine distribution.

\subsection{During a match}

Any referee can interrupt the match at any time. After the referee box
is stopped, both teams have 5 seconds to stop all robot movement. The
match time will be paused during the interruption. A team can decide to
stop the autonomy process of each robot individually at any time of the
match. Doing so has to be announced notably in order to inform the
referee, as this is considered a shut down request according to
\ref{sec:team-setup}. Robots that do not stop within the time limit
will be treated in the same way. Any robot can only be stopped one
time. A second stop announcement leads to permanent extraction of the
related robot.

\subsubsection{Out-of-order}

The downtime generator will take down a maximum of two machines out of
the pool containing production machines and recycling units. It will
do so at random points of time. There will be 6 to 8 of such triggered
events during a match. The machines affected will remain out of order
for 60 to 120 seconds. Every machine can only be forced out of order
once per match. If the machine turns offline during processing or
consumption of mounted a pallet carrier, it will afterwards resume the
process.

\subsubsection{Production Plan}

The referee box will announce a production plan for different
phases of the match. The production plan specifies how many items of
different product variants have to be produced in the current phase.
The number of items can range from 1 to 10 items per phase. Only products which
are covered by the production plan score. In 2013 there will be three phases.
Each of the three phases will last 5 minutes. The first phase will start with
the match start-up. The second phase will start at minute 5, the third at minute
10. The production plan is shown in Table~\ref{tab:production-plan}.

\subsubsection{Late Order Challenge}

The challenge will be induced by the referee box sending a late order
message to the robots. The message specifies the demanded product
variant, a time window and the delivery gate. As a first step, the late
order challenge of 2013 will only demand for product variant
\p3. Furthermore, in 2013 the challenge has to be completed within a
time window of 120 seconds and the late order has to be delivered to
the active delivery gate. 

\section{Tournament}
\label{sec:tournament}
\subsection{Playing Mode}
\textbf{Explain the overall different phases of the tournament.}

\subsection{Tournament scoring specifications}

% The tournament features two stages with the first stage being done in
% league form with several sequels orientating at the number of
% participants and a second stage with playoffs featuring the top 4
% teams.

\paragraph{Round-Robin phase} 
There will be two stages in the competition. The first stage is a
group phase and will be played as a round-robin. The best 4 teams of
the round-robin stage will advance to a playoff round.
%
At the round-robin stage, the teams will  receive the true points
they scored by delivering and producing goods during the
competition. The points will be accumulated in this phase and the
teams will be ranked according to the accumulated points in descending
order.

\paragraph{Playoffs} At the payoff stage, the scoring scheme will be
different. As each team in this phase directly competes with an
opposing team, the team that scores more points as the direct
opponent, will be announced as the winner and 3 points will be awarded
to this team. A loss will be awarded with 0 points. Additionally, if
both teams are unable to score any points during the match by
delivering or producing goods, both team will receive 0 points.
%
% Each match will be resulted with the score of each team. The winning
% team will be awarded 2 major points. In case of a draw both teams will
% be awarded with 1 major point. In case both teams scored zero points,
% no major points will be awarded.
%
In case of a draw within the playoffs, the game time will be extended
by 5 minutes unless both teams scored zero points.
%
If this extension leads to a draw too the overall regular points of
the teams will determine the match winner. If the overall points are
equal too, a direct comparison between the teams in question will
decide. If this fails to resolve the situation, the teams will
approach a coin toss to determine the winner.



\paragraph{Finals.} The best 2 teams of the playoff phase will advance
to the finals. The competition mode for the final is the same as in
the playoff phase.

\bigskip
The detailed seeding will be created at the event. Although the idea
is to allow each participant to challenge each other team the league
can be adjusted to meet time requirements.


\subsection{Gameplay Challenge}

Both the round-robin phase and the playoffs do have the following different gameplay challenges:

% \begin{table}[h]
%   \centering

\paragraph{Round-Robin phase}
\begin{itemize}
\item The active delivery gate will not switch during a match.
\item There will be 3 late order challenges.
\item No late order challenge will be initialized during the first or within the
  last two match minutes.
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Playoffs}
\begin{itemize}
\item The active delivery gate will swap twice - after minutes 7

\end{itemize}    


In both cases, delivered or timed out pallet carriers will be removed
from the game by the administration and therefore cannot be recycled.

related processes and their scoring.




\subsection{Penalties}

The catalog in Table~\ref{tab:infringements} represents the decision
basis for the referees without being exhaustive or binding.
%
The abidance of these rules will be monitored by at least two
referees.  One ``field'' referee will overlook the competition
area. The field referee is allowed to enter the area at any
time. Accidental moving of a puck or similar unintended tampering
resulting from the referees present on the field must be coped with. A
second "station" referee operates the control station for the referee box
to issue the initial start command and monitor the game flow and the
correctness of the digital representation and automatic scoring.


\begin{table}[th]
  \centering
  \mytable{
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l|X}
  \multicolumn{1}{l}{Issue} &\multicolumn{1}{l}{Sanction}\\\hline
  Premature movement & No robot is allowed to move until the referee
  announced the start of the match The faulty robot will be grounded
  for 2 minutes.\\[1ex]
%
  Damaging factory equipment & Theoretical damage to the real
  factory equipment as a result of collisions and negligent actions.
  This behavior will be punished as a minor rule break.\\[1ex]
  % The team will be punished with a score reduction. The total score
  % cannot  drop below zero.\\[1ex]
%
  Not showing up & A team not showing up at all. The team will be
  removed from the tournament unless the team leader can provide a
  sincere explanation.\\[1ex]

  Manual Interference & A manual interference of a team, i.e. touching
  a robot without the referee's permission, during the game will be
  punished as a major rule break.\\[1ex]
%
  Breaking a minor rule & A rule infringement with minor impact on the
  team performance or competition mechanics. Upon decision of
  the referee, 25 \% of the scored points of the team at the time of
  the infringement will be deducted, at least 1 point.\\[1ex]
  %
  Breaking a major rule & A rule infringement with considerable impact
  on the team performance or competition mechanics. Upon decision of
  the referee, 50 \% of the scored points of the team at the time of
  the infringement will be deducted, at least 5 points. \\[1ex]
  % The referee will
  % decide upon calling a team vote or imposing an adequate punishment.\\[1ex]
  % 
  Arguing with the referee & There will be no discussions during a
  match. Each team can make a motion to protest a certain match and
  its result which will be dealt with after the match. There will be a
  warning. Continued disregard will result in a time punishment to the
  team's current or next match.\\[1ex]
%
  Disregarding rules of conduct & Following the rules of conduct
  should be self-explanatory Upon disregard, the referee will impose
  sanctions ranged from time punishments to the team's complete
  removal from the tournament.\\%\hline
  \end{tabularx}  }
  \caption{Infringements}
  \label{tab:infringements}
    
\end{table}


\subsection{Technical Challenge}
  
  Within the league, the technical advances should be documented from
  year to year. Therefore, the Technical Challenge is introduced.
  Each participating team should prepare for participating in any
  number of the following tasks:


  \paragraph{Collision avoidance.~}
  The single robot is to show that it avoids other obstacles and robots.
  Therefore the robot must drive from the input storage to the delivery zone.
  However, the paths between the input storage and the delivery zone will
  be blocked randomly by static obstacles and the robot must not touch any
  of the obstacles. For touching an obstacle, the team receives a penalty.
  The fastest team with the fewest penalty points to reach the delivery
  zone wins this challenge. All other teams are ranked according to
  how fast they were and how many penalties they conceived.
  
  \paragraph{Whack-a-Mole.~}
  A single robot is placed somewhere on the field. It has to detect
  the single shining signal unit on the play field. As soon as it puts
  a puck underneath it, the signal unit is switched off and another
  random signal unit is switched on. The goal of the challenge is to
  switch as many signal units as possible within a given time
  frame. Teams are ranked according to the number of turned-off
  signals.
  

  \paragraph{Free challenge.~}
  Each team will be given 5 minutes to showcase their robot team, e.g.
  show some new robotics developments. The team leaders of
  non-presenting team will judge the performance and rate it with
  points between 0--10.  The team with the most points will win this
  challenge. The other teams are ranked in decreasing point order.

\paragraph{}
  The technical challenge is conducted in the following way: The
  team leader of each participating team agree on a date and time
  during the tournament for the Technical Challenge in their first
  Team leader Meeting. Each team can register for any of the
  challenges. All team leaders have to be present at the time of the
  challenge to judge the other teams. The OC is responsible to conduct
  the Technical Challenge and can appoint team leaders to support in
  conducting the challenges. Each challenge will have a separate
  ranking. In each ranking, the team on the last rank will receive 0
  points, the last-but-one ranked team will receive 1 point etc. The
  points for each ranking will be added and the team with the most
  points accrued over all challenges will be awarded with the
  Logistic Leagues Technical Challenge Award.

% \section{Development / Vision}

% This section is meant to enable discussions and support investment
% decisions for future soft- and hardware acquisitions.

% \subsection{Short term ideas}

% These are ideas that could still be incorporated into the rulebook of
% Istanbul 2011. 

% \subsubsection{Scripted, dynamic obstacles}

% On the way to fully dynamic obstacles this iteration implies a fully
% scripted administration controlled Robotino that follows implicit
% movement rules that are known to all participants.

% \subsection{Midterm planning}
% Additions and alterations for future iterations of this competition


% \subsubsection{Various Production programs}
% A part from the three-staged production process, various goods with
% different work orders and specifications (e.g. top speed, delivery
% strategies...) could be part of the challenge. This addition seems to
% be heavily dependent on Sect.~\ref{sec:supp-flow}.

% \subsubsection{Various order strategies}
% A delivery could consist of more than one final product, it could be
% required to deliver a batch of products, maybe within a certain time
% span, to complete the loading and receive extra points. Also, the
% different delivery gates could obtain a predefined shipping list, for
% example gate 1 requiring 2 Products, 2 M2 and 1 M1, maybe in the
% correct order to enable FIFO, LIFO or other delivery strategies.

% \subsubsection{Simulation league}

% Since there is only the annually world championship and maybe a
% regional preregistration, a simulation platform could be provided,
% where the software framework of teams can be used to compete with
% other teams. Additionally a branch of simulation could be created that
% focuses on the simulation of many AGV and a huge production area in
% order to compete on scalability.

% \subsubsection{Introducing a supportive flow of information}
% \label{sec:supp-flow}

% As the current task only deals with the material stream, it is heavily
% limited to a simple static task. In order to enable a flow of
% information that transports complex orders, a combined effort should
% focus on implementing a data interface that can be used by all teams
% today and in the future. As this would be a giant leap towards the
% industrial application, a general discussion and a lot of effort has
% to be invested into this issue.


% \subsection{Long term Vision}
% Ideas, dreams and ideology that inspire the future development.

% \subsubsection{Complex production machines}
% As there are more ways to interact with a machine than mounting and
% dismounting a loading carrier, it is possible to develop new machine
% types that look different and are completely different to handle.

% \subsubsection{Collaborative Production}
% Teams could be required to cooperate with another team to enable a
% combined supply chain. 

% \subsubsection{Opponent controlled dynamic obstacles}
% No scripted obstacle can truly represent challenges of the industrial
% application. In the long run, an opposing team has to be reinserted
% that is allowed and requested to anticipate the logistic processes in
% real time in order to create worst case scenarios for the teams.

% \subsubsection{Interfacing ERP / SCM}
% The interface used to present orders could be back ended with software
% from real business applications like ERP, PPS, WHM and SCM.

% \subsubsection{JIS / JIT implementation}
% With complex production processes and several other achievements and
% upgrades it could be useful to implement JIS and JIT tasks and
% procedures into the LL, requiring delivery strategies like LIFO, FIFO
% and certain time windows.

\begin{appendix}
\newpage

\section{Engineering reference} \label{apx:sec:engref}
\subsection{The Mobile Robot System}
The mobile robot system Robotino is a platform with an open
mechanical interface for the integration of additional mechanical
devices and an open electrical interface to integrate easily
additional sensors or motors of devices. Power is supplied via two
\SI{12}{\volt} lead gel batteries which permit a running time of up to
two hours.  The scope of delivery likewise includes a charging
device. Robotino is driven by 3 independent, omni-directional drive
units. They are mounted at an angle of \ang{120} to each other. The
three omni-directional drive units of Robotino , defines the robot as
being holonomic, meaning that the controllable degrees of freedom
equals the total degrees of freedom of the robot. The drive units are
integrated in a sturdy, laser welded steel chassis. The chassis is
protected by a rubber bumper with integrated switching sensor.

\subsubsection{Robot dimensions}\label{apx:sec:robot}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textbf{Diameter:} \SI{370}{\milli\metre}
	\item[] \textbf{Height including housing:} \SI{210}{\milli\metre}
 	\item[] \textbf{Overall weight:} approx. \SI{11}{\kilogram}
 	\item[] \textbf{Maximal payload:} about \SI{6}{\kilogram}
 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Drive Unit}
Each of the 3 drive units consists of the following components: DC
Dunker motor with nominal speed of \SI{3600}{rpm} and nominal torque
of \SI{3.8}{\newton\centi\metre}. Integrated planetary gear unit with
a gear ratio of 4:1. Omni-directional wheels of diameter of
\SI{80}{\milli\metre}. Toothed belt with gear wheels providing a
transmission ratio of 4:1.
%
Altogether this provides a gear transmission ratio of
16:1. Incremental encoder with a resolution of 2048 increments per
motor rotation.
%
The motor and gear arrangement is shown in
Figure~\ref{apx:fig:driveunit}.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics{driveunit.png}
\caption{Drive unit with motor (1), encoder (2), omni-directional wheel
(3)}
\label{apx:fig:driveunit}
\end{figure}

The motor speed will be controlled via a PID controller implemented on
a Atmel microprocessor of the controller board of Robotino.

\subsubsection{Sensors}

Robotino is equipped with 9 infrared distance measuring sensors which
are mounted in the chassis at an angle of \ang{40} to one
another. Robotino can scrutinize all surrounding areas for objects
with these sensors.  Each of the sensors can be queried individually
via the controller board. Obstacles can thus be avoided, clearances
can be maintained and bearings can be taken on a selected target. The
sensors are capable of accurate or relative distance measurements to
objects at distances of \SI{4}{\centi\metre} to
\SI{30}{\centi\metre}. Sensor connection is especially simple
including just one analogue output signal and supply power. The
sensors' evaluation electronics determines distance and read it out as
an analogue signal.  The anti-collision sensor is comprised of a
switching strip which is secured around the entire circumference of
the chassis. A reliably recognizable signal is thus transmitted to the
controller unit.  Collisions with objects at any point on the housing
are detected and, for example, Robotino is brought to a
standstill. The inductive proximity sensor is supplied as an
additional component. It serves to detect metallic objects on the
floor and is used for continuous-path control, e.g. it might be used
to detect the blue lines (metallic stripes) on hockey field. It reads
out signals of varying strength depending upon whether it is located
in the middle or at the edge of the metal strip. Path tracking can
thus be controlled in a differentiated fashion.

The inductive proximity sensor must be attached to the mounting
furnished for this purpose, and must be connected to the I/O
interface.  The output voltage is \SI{0}{\volt} to \SI{10}{\volt}. The
sensing range is \SI{0}{\milli\metre} to \SI{6}{\milli\metre}. Path
tracking can also be implemented with the two included diffuse
sensors.  Flexible fiber optic cables are connected to a fiber-optics
unit which works with visible red light. Reflected light is
detected. Different surfaces and colors produce different degrees of
reflection. However, gradual differences in reflected light cannot be
detected. The sensors must be attached to the mountings furnished for
this purpose, and must be connected to the I/O interface.

Robotino is equipped with a color webcam. The webcam is equipped with
a USB interface. Also, there will be integrated a digital Gyroscope
providing a high accuracy of the odometry in the virtual factory.

\subsubsection{Controller Board – 2010 Revision}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{RobotinoOpen.jpg}
\label{apx:fig:robotinoopen}
\end{figure}


The controller housing is connected to the wiring in the chassis via
one plug-in. Thus you can easily take off the controller housing and
you have direct access to the mechanical system. The controller system
of Robotino is divided into two parts – an embedded PC and a
micro-controller interface card: The Controller of Robotino consists of
an embedded PC and a micro-controller interface board. The main
controller is the embedded PC 104 plus controller with the 500 MHz
processor AMD LX800. The PC has a SDRAM of 128 MB and is provided with
a 1 GB flash card. There are numerous communication interfaces on
board:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 $\times$ 100 Mbit Ethernet
\item 2 $\times$ q external USB, 1 $\times$ on-board USB-connector
\item 2 $\times$  RS232
\item 1 $\times$ Parallel port and 1 $\times$ VGA port
\item Wireless LAN Access Point following the standards 802.11/b/g.
\item The access point can be switched into a client mode.  As an
  option you may use WPA2-coding.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software}
Preinstalled is an Ubuntu Linux operating system with real time kernel
running on the embedded PC 104. The main part of the controller is the
Robotino server, a real time Linux application. It controls the drive
units and provides interfaces to communicate with external PC
applications via wifi. There is an API with libraries which allow you
to create applications for Robotino in numerous programming languages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item C++ and C 
	\item C\# 
	\item .net and JAVA 
	\item MatLab and Simulink
	\item Labview
\end{itemize}

You may find a lot of examples concerning using the different API's in
the public forum ``Openrobotino'' at
\url{http://www.openrobotino.org}.

\paragraph{Robotino View} 

Robotino View is a graphical programming language with numerous
prepared function blocks you can easily connect via input and output
parameters to establish more complicated function diagrams. You can use
these function diagrams as subprograms for more complex programming
sequences. To build up general programming sequences Robotino View
follows the international standard IEC 61131-3. You may run Robotino
View on an external PC and Robotino View communicates directly with
the Robotino Server on the PC 104 via wifi in order to control the
robot system. The function blocks receive a direct feedback of the
hardware components such that you can live interact with the robot
system. On the other hand you can download Robotino View programs into
the PC 104 in order to run the applications completely autonomously.
There is a well defined interface to develop own function blocks in C++
or Lua.

\paragraph{Image Processing}

Depending on the Robotino version it might happen that the standard web
camera only provides image data by JPEG compression. This is very
useful if you run your image processing on the PC and exchange the data
via wifi. However, if you would like to run your image processing
algorithms on the Robotino controller then the processor is not
powerful enough in order to pack and to unpack the image data in a
reasonable time. Thus we recommend for running image processing
algorithms on the Robotino controller to use a camera without JPEG
compression, e.g. use the low cost Logitech web camera C250.
